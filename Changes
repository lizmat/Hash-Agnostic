Revision history for Hash-Agnostic

{{$NEXT}}

0.0.18  2026-02-13T19:05:00+01:00
    - Make STORE an only, to make examples in post work.

0.0.17  2024-08-10T16:02:31+02:00
    - Don't call .STORE if there are no values to be stored.  This
      will allow agnostic hashes to be initialized in a TWEAK
      method without going through the local AT-KEY logic.  Issue
      spotted by Tim Nelson in Hash::Ordered

0.0.16  2024-08-10T12:33:55+02:00
    - Better fix for handling .Str and .gist on type objects

0.0.15  2024-08-10T12:06:26+02:00
    - Allow .gist / .Str / .raku / .perl to be called on type objects,
      Tim Nelson++ for spotting this deficiency
    - Modernize pod

0.0.14  2024-07-21T11:27:18+02:00
    - Make sure that .new will actually take any named arguments
      and run the normal object creation logic.  Tim Nelson++ for
      exposing this deficiency
    - Restore "list" and "List" methods, they work again

0.0.13  2024-07-20T12:38:18+02:00
    - Remove "list" and "List" from supported methods list for
      now because of some weird interaction when the role is being
      consumed by a class that has a TWEAK method in it.
    - Add separate CI badges for each OS supported
    - Add sponsor button

0.0.12  2024-04-28T12:05:31+02:00
